    "1. Project Title\n",
    "Predicting Educational Disadvantage from Czech School Inspectorate Reports: A Textual Data Analysis Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Introduction\n",
    "2.1. Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly define your research question: \"Can textual data from Czech School Inspectorate (ČŠI) reports be used to predict educational disadvantage, segregation, or failure in schools?\"\n",
    "2.2. Motivation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain why this question is interesting. For example, highlight the importance of early identification of at-risk schools and how text analysis can uncover patterns not easily visible through traditional metrics.\n",
    "3. Data Collection\n",
    "3.1. Source Identification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the sources of your data, which are the ČŠI reports available through the Czech School Inspectorate's website.\n",
    "Provide a link to the data source as required.\n",
    "3.2. Data Extraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Scraping: Develop a web crawler to automate the downloading of reports, if necessary. Use Python libraries like requests and BeautifulSoup for this task.\n",
    "Metadata: Extract metadata such as school identifiers (e.g., REDIZO), location, and report date.\n",
    "3.3. Data Storage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Store the downloaded reports and metadata in a well-organized \"data\" folder in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "4. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "4.1. Text Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization: Break down the text into tokens (individual words or phrases).\n",
    "Lemmatization: Use the morphodita tool to reduce words to their base forms, addressing the complexities of the Czech language.\n",
    "Stop Words and Noise Removal: Filter out common stop words and non-informative tokens.\n",
    "N-grams: Consider creating bi-grams or tri-grams to capture common phrases that may have predictive power.\n",
    "4.2. Data Transformation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert the cleaned text into numerical features using techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings.\n",
    "4.3. Data Merging:\n",
    "\n",
    "Merge the text features with other relevant data, such as school performance metrics or socio-economic indicators. Use pandas for merging datasets.\n",
    "5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "5.1. Initial Data Exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualize the distribution of text features (e.g., word frequencies).\n",
    "Analyze correlations between text features and target outcomes (disadvantage, segregation, failure).\n",
    "5.2. Data Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use graphs and charts to introduce the data. Visualize the distribution of key terms, document length, and any initial findings.\n",
    "6. Methodology\n",
    "6.1. Machine Learning Models:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with simpler models (e.g., Logistic Regression) to predict the outcomes.\n",
    "Experiment with more complex models like Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.\n",
    "Consider using Ridge or Lasso regressions to handle high-dimensional text data.\n",
    "6.2. Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use cross-validation to assess model performance.\n",
    "Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n",
    "6.3. Causality Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss whether your models allow for causal inference or if they are purely correlational. Address any assumptions necessary for causal claims.\n",
    "7. Results\n",
    "7.1. Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Report the performance of different models. Include tables and graphs to compare results.\n",
    "Discuss how well your model fits the data and the significance of key predictors.\n",
    "7.2. Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a clear summary of your findings. For example, identify which terms or phrases are most predictive of educational disadvantage.\n",
    "8. Conclusion\n",
    "8.1. Answer to Research Question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide a clear answer to your research question based on the analysis.\n",
    "Summarize the implications of your findings for educational policy or practice.\n",
    "8.2. Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the limitations of your study, such as potential biases in the text data or limitations of the models used.\n",
    "Suggest areas for future research or improvements to the current analysis.\n",
    "9. Code Explanation and Documentation\n",
    "9.1. Code Comments and Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that all code is well-commented and explained. Provide a detailed explanation of complex sections to ensure reproducibility.\n",
    "Include a README file in your repository to guide users on how to run the code and understand the analysis.\n",
    "9.2. References:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cite any external code or libraries you use. If you borrow code from online sources, provide proper attribution.\n",
    "10. Submission\n",
    "10.1. Final Check:\n",
    "\n",
    "Review the assignment notebook to ensure all required elements are included and clearly explained.\n",
    "Verify that the notebook is functional and produces all expected outputs.\n",
    "10.2. Push to GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "Push your final notebook and data files to the GitHub classroom repository, ensuring you do not change the notebook's name.\n",
    "10.3. Submit Form:\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the Google form to officially submit your assignment.\n",
    "Potential Challenges:\n",
    "Language Processing: Handling the nuances of Czech language text could be challenging. Be prepared to iterate on your preprocessing steps.\n",
    "Model Complexity: Balancing model complexity and interpretability will be crucial. Start simple and add complexity as needed.\n",
    "Data Integration: Merging text data with other datasets might require careful handling of missing data and mismatched formats.\n",
    "Final Advice:\n",
    "Stay organized and document your work thoroughly. This will not only help in meeting the assignment requirements but also make the project easier to manage.\n",
    "Keep communication open with Jiří and seek feedback regularly to ensure you are on the right track.\n",
    "This plan should provide a comprehensive guide to executing your project in a way that aligns with the assignment requirements."
